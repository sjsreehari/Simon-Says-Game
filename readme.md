# Simon Says Game

## Project Overview
Simon Says Game is an engaging web-based game inspired by the classic memory game "Simon." Players must memorize and replicate sequences of colors displayed by the game. As the player progresses through levels, the sequences become increasingly complex, providing both a fun and challenging experience. The game features multiple color tiles and is responsive, making it playable on various screen sizes.

## Game Rules
1. **Start the Game:** The game begins when the player presses the 'START' button or any key.
2. **Watch the Sequence:** The game displays a sequence of colors. The player must pay attention and memorize the sequence.
3. **Repeat the Sequence:** The player must repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding color tiles in the correct order.
4. **Level Up:** If the player successfully replicates the sequence, a new color is added, and the player advances to the next level.
5. **Game Over:** If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and the player’s score is displayed. The player can then restart the game.
